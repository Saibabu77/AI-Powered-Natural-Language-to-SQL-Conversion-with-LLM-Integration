# Natural Language to SQL – Powered by LLaMA 4 + LangChain + Groq

This project turns plain English into structured SQL queries using cutting-edge LLM technology. It’s fast, smart, and genuinely useful. Whether you're a data scientist tired of repetitive queries or a product builder looking to add natural language capabilities to your app — this tool delivers.

You give it a question like:

> Show me all users who signed up last month.

It gives you back:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE signup_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
```

No fluff. No explanations. Just SQL that works.

## Why this exists

I built this because writing SQL for everyday questions is repetitive, and most "NL-to-SQL" tools are either too slow, too vague, or not production-ready. This one isn't. It runs on Groq's blazing-fast API and uses Meta's LLaMA-4 Scout 17B model via LangChain to generate high-quality queries from scratch — in milliseconds.

## Features

- Uses Meta's LLaMA-4 model tuned for instruction-following
- Built on LangChain for modular, production-ready pipelines
- Groq API for low-latency LLM responses
- Regex-based post-processing to clean up noisy outputs
- Returns only the raw SQL (no markdown, no code blocks)
- Can be integrated into data tools, dashboards, or backends

## How to use

Clone this repo, install the dependencies, and plug it into your own project or script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nl-to-sql
cd nl-to-sql
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then in Python:

```python
from nl_to_sql import generate_sql

query = generate_sql("Get the top 10 products by revenue.")
print(query)
```

You’ll get back something like:

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## File Overview

- `nl_to_sql.py`: The main script. Defines the language model, prompt, and SQL generation function.
- `generate_sql()`: The function you call with your natural language question.
- `extract_sql_from_response()`: A cleanup function that filters out noise and ensures valid SQL output.

## Roadmap



- Optional schema-aware prompt tuning
- Support for multiple SQL dialects (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Web-based interface for demoing queries
- Integration with actual database connections for execution

## Final Thoughts

This isn't some toy demo or proof of concept — it's a serious building block for anyone who wants natural language interfaces over structured data. I built this to be fast, reliable, and actually useful in real-world applications.

If you're building internal tools, analyst assistants, or AI-powered data apps — this can save you hours of time and lines of code.
